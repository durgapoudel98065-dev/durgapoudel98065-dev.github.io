  <h1>Full Stack Development</h1>
  <p>
    Full stack development refers to creating both the <strong>front-end</strong> (what users see)
    and the <strong>back-end</strong> (server, database, application logic) of a web application.
    A Full Stack Developer can work across the entire development process.
